    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=70:65:B6:E8:E0:9B:71:A6:60:6C:9D:3B:8C:1B:93:2F:0E:3D:D6:81%3Bcom.cmput301w18t05.taskzilla.activity

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    70:65:B6:E8:E0:9B:71:A6:60:6C:9D:3B:8C:1B:93:2F:0E:3D:D6:81

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    70:65:B6:E8:E0:9B:71:A6:60:6C:9D:3B:8C:1B:93:2F:0E:3D:D6:81

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

    <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">YOUR_KEY_HERE</string>
